2022-04-08 Changes:
- new set of icons 36x36px (except for photoDB-add.png that remains 48x48px - pls consider moving it out of the gp directory)
- new IMAGE ANCHOR COORDINATES: the suggested X-Y coordinates of the anchor are 18-35 px from the left-top corner
- new icon for road cycling guideposts
- new icon for city quideposts
- a "pole" added to all route marker icons to show the anchor point (where it actually belongs to on the map)
- red dot on horse guidepost shifted inwards from the tip of the plate to make the horse gp easier to distinguish from the others
- new individual icons for "noimg", "missing" and "noref" cases.
  These extra icons are located in the icons36-* directories. Names of the icons are the same as those of the icons36 dir.
- some of the icons may not be needed but a complete set has been produced in all variants for the sake of simplicity
